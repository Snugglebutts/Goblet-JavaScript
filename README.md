        [MIDGARD] - 
            
        [BEGIN REALM 1: LEVEL 1 - THE WIZARD'S TOWER] -
            [SCENE]
                The Wizard, Alvis comes home to his Tower after taking his morning stroll 
                (immediately following the start menu animation) and notices his tower has been 
                broken into. Upon entering the tower he encounters a group of minions and has to 
                fight his way to the observatory.
            [PLAYABLE]
                The player begins at the bottom of the tower, just inside the Tower doorway. 
                Alvis equips [Frigg's Wand], which with him on all of his simple wanderings, 
                and encounters his first enemy -- The Minion (small enemy). 
                Armed with the first two spells, 1 offensive spell: [Arcane Bolt] & 1 
                defensive spell: [Arcane Shield]. 
                The player will be given one enemy to kill to test his [Arcane Bolt], followed 
                by 5 more minions after proceeding. 
                The player will then enounter his second enemy -- The Goblin (large enemy), 
                and given the instruction to block one of his attacks with [Arcane Shield]. 
                After defeating this large enemy, the player will progress, fighting his way 
                to the top floor, The Observatory.
            [SCENE]
                After reaching the observatory, he discovers the party's most prized relic, 
                and source of their heightened power-- the Holy Grail (Goblet) -- has been
                stolen! 
                After this discovery, the Wizard grabs the [Texts of the Vanir] and begins his 
                quest of alerting the other three party members.
        [END REALM 1: LEVEL 1]
        
        [BEGIN REALM 1: LEVEL 2 - THE DWARF'S FORGE -OR- THE WARRIOR'S BARRACKS]
            [SCENE]
                The Wizard travels to the [Dwarf's Forge] in the next town to find the Dwarf, 
                Brokk working at the anvil. The Wizard informs the Dwarf of the missing 
                Goblet and states he must inform the others as well. After hearing of the news, 
                the short-tempered Dwarf grabs his [Blacksmith's Hammer] and jumps into action 
                [running off of scene right]. 
                The Wizard notices that the Dwarf, in his rush of rage skipped past the three
                barrels filled with steel swords, warhammers, and battle axes. The Wizard then
                casts a spell and teleports out of scene.
            [PLAYABLE]
                The player switches to the Dwarf and begins at the entrance of the Forge.
                It appears the band of minions and goblins have followed the Wizard from the
                Tower.
                Similar to the start of the first level, the Dwarf is presented a duo of 
                minions that have broken into his Forge. Armed with his trusty 
                [Blacksmith's Hammer], the Dwarf is given a short instruction on his first
                two attacks, [Swing] & [Swipe]. 
                The player proceeds to the underground Forge (where all Dwarves truly forge 
                their best work!) and discovers more minions and goblins to fight. It appears
                they are attemping to steal the Dwarve's secret ingredient to making the 
                strongest weapons! The [Dwarven Fire Salts]! The player then encounters his 
                third enemy, the Minion Carriage. The player is then tasked with stopping 
                5 carriages from escaping with the [Dwarven Fire Salts]. 
            [SCENE]
                Upon completion, the Dwarf acquires the [Dwarven Fire Salts], and surmises 
                that somebody is targetting the troupe of heroes. The Dwarf decides to forge 
                a Dwarven Lock (unpickable lock, even by the most cunning thieves) and locks 
                his forge, before setting out to join the others at their designated meeting 
                place in the event something were to happen -- the mouth of the Bifrost Bridge, 
                where the portkey to the nine realms is located. 
        [END REALM 1: LEVEL 2]
            
        [BEGIN REALM 1: LEVEL 3 - THE RANGER'S KEEP]
            [SCENE]
                The Wizard appears in the chicken coop of the [Ranger's Keep]. "That's odd. I 
                could have sworn I chose the top floor of the Keep," the Wizard states, 
                dismissively. 
                As he steps out, he sees the Ranger, Orvarr battling a few minions in the 
                courtyard of the burning [Ranger's Keep]. After the two heroes quickly 
                dispatch the remaining minions, the Wizard alerts the Ranger of the stolen
                Goblet, and subsequently, the disruption of his powers. Due to this, the 
                Wizard must meet up with Brokk at the Bifrost Bridge to study the 
                [Texts of the Vanir] to find a temporary resolution [the Wizard exits left].  
                The Ranger then rushes towards the keep to save his most prized possession from 
                the inferno [running off of scene right]. 
            [PLAYABLE]
                The player arrives just inside of the [Ranger's Keep] to find minions & goblins
                filling their carts with precious loot the Ranger has acquired over his past 
                misadventures. 
                The Ranger is armed with his trusty [Thief's Daggar] & [Hunter's Bow], and the 
                player is given a short instruction on how to switch weapons [X], and the light
                attack on both weapons: [Cut] & [Quick Fire].
                The player proceeds through the keep, encountering minions, goblins and minion
                carts in heavy waves.
                The Ranger reaches the perch of the [Ranger's Keep], and encounters the player's
                fourth enemy, the Goblin Captain attempting to break into the Ranger's safe. 
            [SCENE]
                After defeating the goblin captain, the Ranger unlocks the safe and takes his
                [Ring of Invisibility], before heading to the [Trickster's Brothel].
        [END REALM 1: LEVEL 3 - THE RANGER'S KEEP]
        
        [BEGIN REALM 1: LEVEL 4 - THE TRICKSTER'S BROTHEL]
            [SCENE]
                Inside of the [Trickster's Brothel] the Trickster is found swiping month's worth 
                of plunder from yet another group of Vikings while they slept after a night at 
                the brothel. The Trickster is discovered after a drunken Viking stumbles into the
                room, alerting the group. 
            [PLAYABLE]
                The Trickster quickly grabs a [Harlot's Daggar] and prepares to fight, and the 
                player is given a short instruction on the the attacks, [Cut] & [Stab]. The 
                Trickster encounters the player's fifth enemy, the Viking Warrior. The group of
                Vikings begin to burn the [Trickster's Brothel] in anger, and attack the player.
                The player must fight Viking warriors on the escape of the building. 
            [SCENE]
                After escaping the brothel and defeating the Viking warparty, the Trickster 
                assesses his loot and finds [Borr's Bag of Bombs]. The Ranger arrives moments 
                later, not much surprised by the chaos of the recent situation the Trickster
                encountered, and informs him the band of heroes must once again come together to
                retreive the stolen Goblet. Since the Trickster's late business is no longer, he
                agrees and joins the Ranger on the path to the Bifrost to meet up with the 
                remaining group.

            • Biography: 
                Sindri is the sole Human Mage in [Midgard], trained by the Vanir -- masters of 
                sorcery, with their power granted from the gods themselves. While studying the
                ancient Vanir texts, Brokk approached him requesting advice on imbuing his forge 
                with the Arcane Arts to handle temperatures higher than any other forge. This 
                allowed Brokk and his brother, Eitri to forge [Thor's Hammer], Mjolnir, with the
                heart of a dying sun.
